Hi [Manager’s Name],

Here’s a quick summary of what we can do with Azure Cosmos DB (Mongo API) for user access, audit logs, and rollback:

1. User Access Options
Option A – Individual Users (50+ users):
	•	Each user gets their own MongoDB username/password (using email ID).
	•	Role-based access (read / read-write / admin).
	•	When someone leaves, we remove their user account immediately.
	•	Provides better accountability per person.

Option B – Shared Credentials (2 connection strings):
	•	Two shared users (e.g., Read-only & Read/Write).
	•	Credentials can be rotated.
	•	Easier to manage, but no individual accountability.

2. Activity Logs (Audit Visibility)
What we can see:
	•	Infrastructure changes
	•	RBAC/role assignments
	•	Who created/modified/deleted access
	•	Network, backup, and config changes

What we cannot see:
	•	MongoDB user logins
	•	Who created collections
	•	Who inserted/updated/deleted data

This is a limitation of Cosmos DB (Mongo API).
We’re exploring Log Analytics (Diagnostic Logs) to view DB operations (create/insert/update/delete), but user identity is still not captured.

3. Rollback / Recovery
	•	We can use Point-in-Time Restore to restore the entire database account (up to ~30 days).
	•	The restore creates a new account; data can be copied back.
	•	We cannot roll back individual collections or documents.
